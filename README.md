## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
 
  *Giving a user the ability to provide a description of a software to build into the AI, then having the AI build the software from start to finish*


* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
  
  The intended customer is businesses that want to avoid paying the full cost of a development team, in addition to developers using it to help make their jobs easier by cutting out a lot of the manual programming required in getting the initial minimum viable product built. In the beginning stages of the Devin software. There will likely still be some manual tweaks and adjustements to the code provided by the "Devin" AI software. 

  The Market for this is ginormeous, it is hard to put a number on the market size, because ability can be used for all different kinds of use cases, and industries.  

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**

  The solution that Cognition provides that others havenâ€™t been able to provide yet, is the ability to take a prompt of a desired software to build, and build that software from start to finish. 
  ### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
  

  | **Technologies** | **Use-Case** |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | Code Editor |  Writing and editing the code for the software |
  | Command Line | Running commands to communicate with API's and run various commands |
  | Web Browser | Pull up API documentation to learn from it and use the API calls within the code that it writes |
  | Git | clone code repositories to use within the code base |
  | Npm | Install frontend software dependencies |
  | Ubuntu | Backend Operating system | 
  | Docker | Run Containers to accomplish various tasks |
  
  There are many more technologies involved with this project. I will continue to add to this list as I see more technologies used. 


## Landscape

* **What field is the company in?**
  * Artificial Intelligence 
  * Software Development 
  * Engineering

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?**

  Some of the trends and innovations in this field over the years would be large language models trained and used for deciphering a prompt provided by an end user, to then take that prompt and send a response back to the user, which answers the user in a meaningful way. 

  Other trends and innovations include:
    * image generation 
    * video generation 
    * audio generation 
    * image recognition 
    * voice recodition
    * code generation 

* **What are the other major companies in this field?**
  * OpenAI (ChatGPT) - Can generate code, images, debug error messages, and answering various questions. 
  * GitHub (CoPilot) - Can generate code on the fly within a code editor
  * Google (Bard) - competitor to OpenAI, same use cases.
  *  Microsoft (Bing) - competitor to OpenAI, same use cases. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  *This new AI software is still in the testing phases, and has not likely been adopted into many businesses, however this is a very good proof of concept that could potentially replace development teams, or at least drastically reduce the necessary team size.*

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? 
  * speed
  * accuracy
  * capabilities
  * accessibility

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
  Cognition is doing very well with the consideration of how recent they started the company. They have already gotten recognition in bloomberg articles, which can be found [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/cognition-ai-is-a-peter-thiel-backed-coding-assistant)
