# AI Case Study

## The AI company (Cognition)

** *Credit goes to **Jake Backues** for introducing this AI Company to the University of Utah AI Bootcamp Class.*

* **Name of company:** *Cognition*

* **Who are the founders of the company?** *Scott Wu*

* **When was the company incorporated?** 

  *Based on the "whois" domain registry data. The [cognition-labs.com](https://cognition-labs.com) domain was registered on January 11, 2024. The [twitter](https://twitter.com/cognition_labs) account was created in January 2024. With this data, it is assumed that the company was launched in January of 2024.*

* **How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

  >*"The company is well funded, including a $21 million Series A led by Founders Fund."*

## Business Activities

* **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**
 
  *Giving a user the ability to provide a description of a software to build into the AI, then having the AI build the software from start to finish*


* **Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**
  
  The intended customer is businesses that want to avoid paying the full cost of a development team, in addition to developers using it to help make their jobs easier by cutting out a lot of the manual programming required in getting the initial minimum viable product built. In the beginning stages of the Devin software. There will likely still be some manual tweaks and adjustements to the code provided by the "Devin" AI software. 

  The Market for this is ginormeous, it is hard to put a number on the market size, because ability can be used for all different kinds of use cases, and industries.  

* **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?**

  The solution that Cognition provides that others havenâ€™t been able to provide yet, is the ability to take a prompt of a desired software to build, and build that software from start to finish. 
  ### Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?
  

  | **Technologies** | **Use-Case** |
  | :---: | :---: |
  | Code Editor |  Writing and editing the code for the software |
  | Command Line | Running commands to communicate with API's and run various commands |
  | Web Browser | Pull up API documentation to learn from it and use the API calls within the code that it writes |
  | Git | clone code repositories to use within the code base |
  | Npm | Install frontend software dependencies |
  | Ubuntu | Backend Operating system | 
  | Docker | Run Containers to accomplish various tasks |
  
  There are many more technologies involved with this project. I will continue to add to this list as I see more technologies used. 


## Landscape

* **What field is the company in?**
  * Artificial Intelligence 
  * Software Development 
  * Engineering

* **What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?**

  Some of the trends and innovations in this field over the years would be large language models trained and used for deciphering a prompt provided by an end user, to then take that prompt and send a response back to the user, which answers the user in a meaningful way. 

  Other trends and innovations include:
    * image generation 
    * video generation 
    * audio generation 
    * image recognition 
    * voice recognition
    * code generation 

* **What are the other major companies in this field?**
  * OpenAI (ChatGPT) - Can generate code, images, debug error messages, and answering various questions. 
  * GitHub (CoPilot) - Can generate code on the fly within a code editor
  * Google (Bard) - competitor to OpenAI, same use cases.
  *  Microsoft (Bing) - competitor to OpenAI, same use cases. 

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?

  *This new AI software is still in the testing phases, and has not likely been adopted into many businesses, however this is a very good proof of concept that could potentially replace development teams, or at least drastically reduce the necessary team size.*

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? 
  * speed
  * accuracy
  * capabilities
  * accessibility

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
  Cognition is doing very well with the consideration of how recent they started the company. They have already gotten recognition in bloomberg articles, which can be found [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-12/cognition-ai-is-a-peter-thiel-backed-coding-assistant)


## Recommendations

* **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

  * A couple options that I would suggest that the company offer to its clients, would be a few different packages. One would be the package they currently are already offering, which is the ability to develop a software from start to finish, but another product that could be beneficial to offer is a security auditing service either driven by AI or a team that manually audits the software the had been built by the AI software. 

  With AI building a software from start to finish. The code that it writes could easily be mistakenly written by the AI in a way that could be vulnerable to security holes, such as the following common vulnerabilities listed below
  
   * Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
   * Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) 
   * Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   * SQL Injection
   * Brute Force Attacks
   * Command Injection
   * Directory Traversal / Path Traversal

* **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

  * Offering this as an additional service would help to ensure that there is less risk of legal problems, if a company were to ever get compromised due to the software written by the AI being open to security holes. The responsibility and risk would land on the end user if they were to not purchase the additional security auditing service. 

  * The work put into manual auditing of the application security for the ones that do purchase the additional security auditing services, could then be implemented into the AI to help improve the security within the code that the AI produces. If any vulnerabilities are found in the code. The AI can be trained to no longer produce that vulnerable code moving forward.

* **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

  The technologies that this additional product would utilize is a seperate AI model that is build around security pentesting, This AI model could utilize the various tools used within pentests such as metasploit and burp suite. Along with many others. The security AI model could then be used for future audits to speed up the process of auditing other built software, in addition to more manual in depth testing.   

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
